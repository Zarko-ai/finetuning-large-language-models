# Course Overview: Fine-Tuning LLMs for Your Dataset [GO TO COURSE](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/finetuning-large-language-models/)

In this course, you will learn the **key steps for fine-tuning a Large Language Model (LLM)** on your own dataset. The course covers both theoretical foundations and practical approaches, helping you understand how to prepare data, train models, and evaluate results effectively.

## What You Will Learn

1. **Understanding Fine-Tuning**
   - What fine-tuning does to your dataset and model.
   - How the process adapts a general-purpose LLM to your specific domain.

2. **Instruction Fine-Tuning**
   - Techniques for aligning LLM responses with task-specific instructions.

3. **Data Preparation**
   - How to structure and clean your dataset for fine-tuning.
   - Formatting input–output pairs for supervised tasks.

4. **Tokenization**
   - Concepts of padding and truncation.
   - Why tokenization impacts model training and performance.

5. **Training Process**
   - Step-by-step breakdown of the fine-tuning pipeline.
   - Hyperparameters and optimization techniques.

6. **Model Evaluation**
   - Benchmarks for LLMs, including:
     - ARC (AI2 Reasoning Challenge)  
     - HellaSwag  
     - MMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding)  
     - TruthfulQA  
   - How to assess performance after fine-tuning.

7. **Error Analysis**
   - Identifying and addressing common issues such as:
     - Misspellings  
     - Repetition  
     - Overly long or off-topic responses  

8. **Model Size vs. Task Requirements**
   - Choosing the right model size for your task:
     - **Smaller models (400M–1B parameters):** good for classification and simpler tasks.  
     - **Larger models:** better suited for generative tasks like writing long-form text.  

9. **Efficiency & Optimization Techniques**
   - Methods to reduce model complexity.  
   - Strategies for improving accuracy and performance.  
   - Overview of modern approaches (LoRA, adapters, quantization, etc.).

## Important Notes

1. **Benchmarks and Generalization**
   - Benchmarks often work well on base (pretrained) models.  
   - ⚠️ **Note:** After fine-tuning, models may perform **better on your dataset** but can **lose performance on standard benchmarks** and may generalize less effectively to other tasks.


2. **Data Augmentation**
   - If you don’t have enough real-world data, you can generate synthetic data using larger LLMs before fine-tuning.

3. **Practical Fine-Tuning Workflow**
   - Define your task clearly.  
   - Collect input–output data relevant to your task.  
   - Start with a smaller model (400M–1B parameters).  
   - Experiment with varying data sizes.  
   - Evaluate results regularly to monitor progress.  
   - Collect more data to improve robustness.  
   - Scale up to larger models for higher performance if needed.
